    Two S4 R class are defined in this package. The first one called Datasettorep allows to store a dataset as a matrix and a dataframe of metadata. The other one called
    Bibliodata allows to store several object of the class Datasettorep and is associated to a function dedicated to launch a shiny app. This application can be used to do representations
